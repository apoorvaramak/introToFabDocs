My inspriation for this is those lamps with the moving film that I remember from my childhood.

I had one that was underwater themed and I liked the idea of it, so I wanted to go with something 

like that. From there I decided what motor powered part I wante to work with, and I liked the 

computer fan that was linked on the website. So, I worked from there and decided something fun I 

could make was a jellyfish decoration that flowed with the wind of the fan, like a jellyfish through water.

When i was making my drawings, I did not have all my pieces yet so I wasn't sure how exactly I was going to put them together.

That would depend on how big the pieces were and whatever other pieces I would add on later. So, there are a couple different

ideas for layouts in my initial drawings.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

For raw materials I used: 

* Battery Pack
* Batteries
* Floral Foam
* Yarn
* Cloth
* Shower cap
* Computer fan
* Hot glue

The battery pack was to hold the batteries that I was connecting to the computer fan to make the "tentacles" of the jellyfish move. The

floral foam was initially going to be the body of the jellyfish, but this semisphere was too small, so I just used it to hold the battery pack.

The yarn was used to make tentacles. Cloth was also used to make tentacles and as a piece to glue the tentacles to so I didn't need to attach 

all of them directly to the fan. The shower cap was what I used as the body in the final product. And hot glue was used to stick everything together.
