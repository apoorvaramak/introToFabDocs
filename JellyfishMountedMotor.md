My inspriation for this is those lamps with the moving film that I remember from my childhood.

I had one that was underwater themed and I liked the idea of it, so I wanted to go with something 

like that. From there I decided what motor powered part I wante to work with, and I liked the 

computer fan that was linked on the website. So, I worked from there and decided something fun I 

could make was a jellyfish decoration that flowed with the wind of the fan, like a jellyfish through water. 




<span style= "font-size:24px">**Drawings**</span>

When i was making my drawings, I did not have all my pieces yet so I wasn't sure how exactly I was going to put them together.

That would depend on how big the pieces were and whatever other pieces I would add on later. So, there are a couple different

ideas for layouts in my initial drawings.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

For raw materials I used: 

* Battery Pack
* Batteries
* Floral Foam
* Yarn
* Cloth
* Shower cap
* Computer fan
* Hot glue

The battery pack was to hold the batteries that I was connecting to the computer fan to make the "tentacles" of the jellyfish move. The

floral foam was initially going to be the body of the jellyfish, but this semisphere was too small, so I just used it to hold the battery pack.

The yarn was used to make tentacles. Cloth was also used to make tentacles and as a piece to glue the tentacles to so I didn't need to attach 

all of them directly to the fan. The shower cap was what I used as the body in the final product. And hot glue was used to stick everything together.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Process**</span>

First, I started with creating a place to hold my battery pack. I was going to nest the whole fan and the battery pack in the foam, but then I realized

that the foam semi-circle was too small. So, I just cut out a rectangle with a paring knife and used that as a space to hold the battery pack. 

![IMG_0232](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/116936849-5f2e1880-ac36-11eb-9c48-3eeead13812a.jpg)

After that, I held it in place with the metal disc and screws that came with the computer fan pack, which was the pack listed on the fab website. To do this, 

I just put the battery pack with the batteries inside, put the grill on top, and stuck the screws into the loops in the grill made for the screws while pushing

them into the floral foam, which effectively held everything in place.

From there, at first I tried to attach a bunch of yarn strings that I cut to a square piece of cloth that I was going to attach to the bottom of the fan. However,

I realized that the fan was not strong enough to blow air through the material, so I had to change up my plan. 

![IMG_0235](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/116936842-5dfceb80-ac36-11eb-9b3c-e9e109e3f7a7.jpg)

Instead, I cut a long strip of fabric that could be wrapped around the fan and glued pieces of yarn to the outside so yarn would be along the edges of the fan without 

anything obstructing the fan. To get the body, at first I was thinking of just wrapping all these pieces with a piece of cloth and tying it up at the bottom so

I could get the different looking tentacles that are noticeable near center of a jelyfish. However, because this obstructed the fan I had to think of something else. 

So, I came up with the idea of using a shower cap as the top because it could cinch onto the edges of the fan and was the right shape. 

![IMG_0293](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/116936826-5a696480-ac36-11eb-8f17-75f10fc688bd.jpg)

From there, I just was hot gluing all my parts together and made sure to have the battery pack's and the fan's wires sticking out so that I could connect them to start

the fan. I was able to get this to work a few times. However, I felt like the battery pack didn't have enough exposed wire to fit into the compartment made to connect

to the fan's wires. So, I stripped them a little. I think I stripped them too hard because the ends because wire became a little frayed. 

![IMG_0284](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/116936837-5ccbbe80-ac36-11eb-8056-d9c9a7ade96a.jpg)

However, I didn't really notice this and tried to connect the fan to the battery pack again and felt a little heat. I quickly disconnected them, pulled the pieces apart, 

and replaced the old battery pack with a replacement. I think this fried the fan though because I haven't been able to get it running again. Everything still looks the same,

the fan just doesn't run anymore. 

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Tools**</span>

* Glue gun
* Wire strippers
* Ruler
* Paring Knife
* Fabric Scissors

I used the glue gun to attach many things together, the pieces of yarn to the cloth, strips of cloth to the fan blades, and cloth to the outside of the fan. I used the wire

strippers to strip the wires on my first battery pack. I used the ruler to measure out how much I wanted to cut from the floral foam, which I cut out with the paring knife.

Finally, I used the fabric scissors to cut cloth strips and strings of yarn.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Final Product**</span>

My final product is shown here:

I'm happy with how it turned out because I like the way it looks. I'm pleased with my use of other materials and how well

that turned out. If I could do anything different I would have gotten another fan so that I could actually have it running or I would've

been more careful with the wire strippers. Overall, this was a fun project to work on and I liked being able to work with technology

without feeling overwhelmed with creating circuits and other complicated things associated with tech.
