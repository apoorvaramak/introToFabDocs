<span style= "font-size:24px">**Inspiration**</span>
My inspiration came from decorating my room. I was thinking of things that I could make with two materials that I would want 

for a wall decoration, and I remembered how much I used my cork board back at home. Since we talked about cork in class

and I thought that it'd be a fun material to work with, I decided that this would be a good project that I could make with 

two different materials. 

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Drawings**</span>

When I was planning this all out, I wasn't sure how I was going to cut up my cork because I didn't have the blocks yet. So,

there are a few different versions of my drawings depending on work many pieces of cork I was going to put together to make

the board. I also wasn't sure about what material I was going to use as the back. So, I just labelled it as either carboard

or particle board.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

The raw materials I used were:

* Cork blocks
* Particle Board
* Glue
* Mirror pieces

I used the cork blocks as the actual cork board and the particle board as the back panel so that all the cork chunks would stay 

together. The glue was used to stick the cork together, to the particle board, and to stick the mirror pieces on the cork. Then

the mirror was just used as decoration. Initially, I was thinking of using the mirror as a second material, but then I realized I needed

something else to hold the cork together, so that's when I added the particle board.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Process**</span>

The first thing I did after deciding on what my project was going to be was order the cork blocks. I was searching for other materials that 

I could use as my second material and I found mirror tiles that I thought would add a nice deocrative flair and be a cool second material.

Then, I realized I needed something as a back panel to hold my board together because the bork blocks were much to small to be a whole 

cork board without piecing together tiles of it. So, I got particle board for that after I decided that cardboard would be too flimsy. 

To cut the cork blocks, the first problem I ran into was that the miter saw was not tall enough to cut it. So, I needed to use the downstairs

band saw because that one is able be adjusted so that my cork piece could be cut into tiles. To do this, I just used a jig that had a 90 degree

cut already and the straight edge that is part of the band saw. This proved a little difficult because keeping the whole piece straight the 

entire time took a lot of patience. That was only to make one type of cut. The second cut I had to make I used the miter saw, and since it was still

too long, I had to loosen the back piece so that it could be pulled forward. After that, I glued all the pieces of cork together. I was struggling to 

find the right type of glue in the beginning. At first, I tried using gorilla glue, but that just snuck into the cork. I found that tacky glue 

was the best glue for the job.

After gluing the pieces together, I started gluing on the mirror pieces. For these, I used the gorilla glue because it showed much less than the 

tacky glue and if the glue was added to the back of the mirror tiles, the gorilla glue wasn't a problem.

For the particle board I got a very large piece, so to cut it down I had to use the panel saw. After I got that cut, I cut it once again in the miter

saw. Once it was the right shape, I glued the cork with the mirrors attached to the panel of particle board. 

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Tools**</span>

 * Miter Saw
 * Panel Saw
 * Band Saw
 * Ruler
 
 The ruler was used for making measurements and guidelines to make sure that I cut everything to the right size. I used the miter saw to cut the cork and 
 
 particle baord. I used the panel saw to cut the particle voard the first time. Finally, I used the band saw to make the initial cuts in the cork. 
 
 I forgot to get a video of me using the panel saw, so I didn't get many images of the tools I was using.

Here is the final product:

I really like how this one turned out because I enjoyed working with the new materials. I struggled a little with getting the cork pieces to be properly 

sized and cut on a 90 degree angle, but I think it all worked out in the end. Some cork pieces aren't perfectly parallel to the particle board, but everything

is staying in place and it works, so I'm ok with that for a week's worth of work. Otherwise, I think everything in this project went over pretty well, including

learning how to use new machines and how to make machines I've already used do new things.
