<span style= "font-size:24px">**Inspiration**</span>

My inspiration came from wall art. At first, I was thinking of making something similar to a bead curtain like these:

However, tying all those little pieces together would take much too long for a week and so would laser cutting all those 

individual pieces. So instead, I made them large and more spread out but still hanging  almost like a bead curtain. I was 

inspired by creative wall decor that I saw like this:

In the end it was a mix of the two where I chose my own shape, which is a bear because I like them and think their silhouettes

make great decor. 

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Drawings**</span>

My drawings were not my own because I did not create the bear shape myself. To do this, I took a premade image of a bear silhouette, 

made it into a black and white icon, and thinned the lines so it was small enough for the laser cutter to know that it is a cut and not

an engraving.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

The raw materials I used were:

* Purple acrylic
* Purple yarn
* A dowel

The only thing I laser cut was my acrylic but I used the yarn to attach the pieces together and the dowel as a hanging rod.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Process**</span>

I wanted to make sure that I had a lot of practice with the laser cutter before I used my expensive acrylic so my process involved

a lot of trying different materials and seeing what was best for editing speed and power if I needed to for my piece of acrylic in the end. 

First, I used a piece of cardboard and tried both cutting out and engraving. This was just to make sure that I could figure out how to 

cut out and engrave on the same piece and what kind of maneuvering had to be done for these to both be done on one piece.

After that, I decided to see what I could do with acrylic. At first, I got some clear acrylic for practice, but also to see how it would

turn out after cutting. It was a little burnt at the edges, but I was able to cut out my first bear shapes so that was a success.

I just edited the illustrator file to create bears that were cut out and not just engraved for the first acrylic. After I figured out 

how to do this, I moved onto my final piece, the purple acrylic that I wanted to use. For this, I just created a 24 x 12 template that was

filled with as many cut outs of bears as possible. From there, I used the presets on the laser cutter for quarter inch thick acrylic and let

the laser cutter do it's magic. From that, I got a lot of purple acrylic bears that I used to assemble the final product.

I used purple yarn to tie the bears together. I created three strings of bears, which I would then hang on the dowel. This proved difficult

because the bears have a lot of small niches that the yarn got caught in and were tangling easily. I still have to be very careful while moving it

to avoid them getting all mixed up. To cut the dowel to the correct length, I just used the miter saw. Thne, I tied the three strings of bears to the dowel,

making sure to space them out well. 

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Tools**</span>

The tools I used were:

* Laser cutter
* Miter saw
* Scissors

I used the laser cutter to cut the bear pieces, the miter saw to cut the dowel, and the scissors to cut the yarn.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Final Product**</span>

My final product is here:

I struggled a little to get a good picture but I really like the work I've done. The laser cutter was a little intimidating to use at first,

but I think that this project really helped me learn how to use it and not be scared of using it just because it has the potential

to be dangerous.
