For my inspiration, at first I wanted to make coasters. They were brought up in class, and I thought

that it would be a fun project that would also be nice for my apartment, which does not have any coasters.

I didn't want to make just any coasters, so I was thinking about adding some shape to it. At first I thought 

of making circles, like these coasters:

However, I decided I wanted it to be more me, so I set to making them into the shape of hearts because I thought they

would be cute. The wood sides were not as large as I thought they would be, so the hearts ended up being not really large enough

to be coasters, however now I have five matching heart decorations for my room.


<span style= "font-size:24px">**Drawings**</span>

My drawings for this project were a lot less complex because I was really just drawing out ideas for coasters, 

which are really just slabs of wood being cut into shapes. I did draw some ideas out for jigs, but when I got to the shop, 

there was already a jig that worked for what I wanted, which was just a 90 degree cut that I could use to hold the corners of the 

wooden squares I cut out to push through the band saw.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

For raw materials, I used:

* Wooden planks
* Wood glue
* Cardboard

This was a lot less than usual because I made my entire project out of wooden planks, I just needed the wood glue to

adhere them together because they were not thick enough on their own.

I used the cardboard to create templates of what I wanted the coasters to be shaped like so that they would all be identical.


<span style= "font-size:24px">**Process**</span>

For my process, the first thing I needed to do was glue the pieces of wood together. For that, I attached the two pieces using 

wood glue, and clamped them together to a work table using a c-clamp. I left it overnight to let the glue fully dry. Here I realized

I did not use enough wood glue because there were so cracks between my two pieces of wood, which I had to fix later.

After that, I used an exacto knife and ruler to cut notches at a half inch so that I could mark where I wanted to make my cuts on

the board. From there, I used the miter saw to cut off a bunch of half inch squares. I made sure to cut extras for practice and so that

I had ones with the least amount of space between the boards as some parts had more wood glue than others.

From there, I traced the outline of one of the squares onto a piece of paper, and used a straight edge and some measurements to create a geometric

heart template. From there, I tested this out on one of the pieces and then edited it until it was to my liking. Then, I took a piece of cardboard

and cut out the same template so I would have a more durable template.

After that, I traced this onto all the wooden slabs I cut out. From there, I took the pieces to the bandsaw and started practicing 

cutting them out. This took many tries, but I was able to get five that were pretty close by the end of it.

After I got the geometric shapes, I used the power sander to sand down the sides. This was to get that as close in shape and size as 

possible because working with the bandsaw was much less precise than I was hoping for. I made sure to smooth the edges and to shave 

some parts of the sides where I could. The piece at the top center of the heart was not reachable by the power sander, so I had to use normal

sand paper to get it as smooth and similar shaped as possible.

After that, I used tung oil to finish them.

My final product is shown here:

They aren't as perfect as I would like them to be, but I'm happy with how they turned out and hw close in shape and size that I 

got them to end up.
