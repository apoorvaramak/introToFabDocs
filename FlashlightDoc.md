<span style= "font-size:24px">**Inspiration**</span>

At first I wanted to create a candle that looked like a Diwali candle, where the flame would be an LED.

Diwali candles are these small, petal-shaped candles that are lit for Diwali, the Indian festival of lights.

I tried doing this by creating a circuit, but then I realized that I was struggling to do so. Even when I tried with a breadboard,

I was having trouble with getting the LED to light. Once I got it, I realized the breadboard would have to be a part of my design,

which I didn't want. So, I scrapped that idea and went for a more traditional candle, like these:

That way, I could use an actual flashlight and build around it.


<span style= "font-size:24px">**Drawings**</span>

At first, when using the whole flashlight, I was thinking of pulling it apart and having it be something like a shake flashlight, 

which was inspired by the shake flashlight example in the flashlight instructables [here](https://www.instructables.com/Shake-Flashlight-1/)

Here is the drawing I made to go along with that:

That didn't work out with how my flashlight was laid out, so I decided to keep the flashlight intact and just build around it. 

I made the drawing for what my flashlight candle turned out to be here:

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

For raw materials I used:

* cardboard
* a flashlight
* duct tape 
* plastic packaging
* hot glue
* a plastic baggie

I didn't take enough pictures of the raw materials but here are some i found:

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Process**</span>

At first, I was trying to go with a circuit I created myself that I would just hide all the wiring into the petal body of the candle. 

However, this proved difficult because I could not get the LED to light consistently. This is what I was trying to do with my breadboard

after giving up on trying without it.

After I scrapped that idea, I just used a normal flashlight and tried to disassemble it to make it a shake flashlight. There were 

a few different things I tried but I came across a problem in which the metal side and the metal spring had to both touch the end of the 

flashlight, which didnt work with shaking based on how the flashlight was built because the bottom is slightly too big to just slip in,

it needs to be screwed in. 

Here's where I tried to attach the metal sides together so that shaking the piece would make the spring touch the metal end on the inside on the flashlight:

After that, I tried to keep the flashlight whole and started to build around it instead. I used a cardboard tube to go around the flashlight and then duct taped

over the whole thing to make it uniform. I had cardboard circles cut out that I used on top and below to close out the cardboard tube. To make the plastic flame, I cut

off the corner of a plastic bad and bunched up the corners of the cut off end. Then, I put that into a hole I cut into the cardboard circle on top of the flashlight. 

I covered all that in duct tape pictured here:

After that, I covered the sides with plastic box siding as I thought it looked more like white candle wax. To make it seem like candle was lit, I 

added some hot glue down the sides to make it seem like dripping candle wax.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Tools**</span>

The tools I used were: 

* a hot glue gun
* scissors
* a paring knife

In the end, I created a candle that might not be the most techincally difficult, but something that I'm proud of given the trial and error that went into it. 

Here are some pictures:
