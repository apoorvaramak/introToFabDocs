At first I wanted to create a candle that looked like a Diwali candle, where the flame would be an LED.

Diwali candles are these small, petal-shaped candles that are lit for Diwali, the Indian festival of lights.

I tried doing this by creating a circuit, but then I realized that I was struggling to do so. Even when I tried with a breadboard,

I was having trouble with getting the LED to light. Once I got it, I realized the breadboard would have to be a part of my design,

which I didn't want. So, I scrapped that idea and went for a more traditional candle, like these:

That way, I could use an actual flashlight and build around it.

At first, when using the whole flashlight, I was thinking of pulling it apart and having it be something like a shake flashlight, 

which was inspired by the shake flashlight example in the flashlight instructables [here](https://www.instructables.com/Shake-Flashlight-1/)

Here is the drawing I made to go along with that:

That didn't work out with how my flashlight was laid out, so I decided to keep the flashlight intact and just build around it. 

I made the drawing for what my flashlight candle turned out to be here:

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

For raw materials I used:

* cardboard
* a flashlight
* duct tape 
* plastic packaging
* hot glue
* a plastic baggie

I didn't take enough pictures of the raw materials but here are some i found:
