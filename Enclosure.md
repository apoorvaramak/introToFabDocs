<span style= "font-size:24px">**Inspiration**</span>

My inspiration came from the cardboard examples shown in class. The phone made out of cardboard was something that I really liked 

because the idea of cardboard being used to make something that seems technologically advanced is an interesting concept to me. So, 

I decided to take inspiration from this and made it more applicable to something in my life, like a video game controller.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Drawings**</span>

Since I wanted to create a game controller, I decided the best way to do that was to laser cut the cardboard. So, my drawings for 

this are my drawing in illustrator. I took an already created outline of a video game controller and made it into an icon that I

thinned out so that it could be laser cut. Then, I created a button that had the xbox logo engraved on it for the center button on

an xbox controller. I also measured out my breadboard and created some rectangles to make a box that would hold my breadboard and 

electronics.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Raw Materials**</span>

The raw materials I used were:

* Carboard
* Glue
* Breadboard
* Arduino Push Buttons
* Arduino Joystick
* Wires

The cardboard was used to create the piece and the glue was used to hold pieces together. THe Breadboard is just inside, but it is not 

serving a purpose right now, I just wanted to have it there so if I wanted to I could make this functioning in the future. The push buttons 

and joystick are used like they are on a video game controller. THe Wire are being used to keep the joystick base in place on the breadboard.

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Process**</span>

So first, I started with creating the files in illustrator. I explained how I made these earlier in the drawing section. After that, I made sure

to measure the size of my buttons, joystick, breadboard, and other components so that I could size them properly in illustrator and rearrange the 

controller based on that. At first, I was planning on just cutting out the rectangles to make the box that would be used to hold the breadboard, but

this turned out to be difficult because the cardboard was hard to cut properly. At first I made the box base too large.

![IMG_9867](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/115320545-1feccb80-a150-11eb-99a3-328b5b0a0595.jpg)

Then, I tried laser cutting the pieces but realized that I didn't measure the height needed properly, so then the box was too tall. 

![IMG_9882](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/115320547-211df880-a150-11eb-80e5-4cc32790b55c.jpg)

To fix this, I just cut down the laser cut pieces with some scissors and then it was the perfect size for my breadboard and to fit between my controller

front and back. 

While I was laser cutting my rectangles, I also laser cut my controller front and back. The front was the file I made in illustrator and the back was the

same, but instead I got rid of all the buttons that were supposed to be cut into it. 

![IMG_9878](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/115320831-95f13280-a150-11eb-8691-9b1fabef8210.jpg)

After all my pieces were cut, I started assembling. I struggled a little with placement as I need a way for the buttons to be pressed without destroying 

the cardboard, so I need something as a backing for the buttons to keep them in place. What I ended up doing was cutting out squares of cardboard and sticking

the legs of the buttons into the cardboard.

I continued to assmemble by placing my breadboard in the box and lining up where I would need to put the base for the joystick so that it would line up with

the hole that I made for the joystick. Because the base has no way of attaching to the breadboard without soldering, which I did not want to do because 

I did not want to make this permanent, I attached the base with some wires. 

![IMG_9873](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/115321103-26c80e00-a151-11eb-9c13-d20b851ec040.jpg)

I kept adding on pieces and making sure everything was enclosed and that I could keep all the electronics in the box that I made. Because this project wants 

the enclosure to be something that is easily opened, I added two pieces of cardboard to bottom of the top piece. Then, I glued the box I made from the breadboard

to the bottom controller piece. So, I could slot the cardboard pieces on the top piece into the box, closing it securely, but then it would still be able to 

be opened again. Then, I attached all my buttons and made sure everything lined up, so that my controller was completed.


<span style= "font-size:24px">**Tools**</span>

The tools I used were:

* Laser cutter
* Ruler
* Scissors
* Hot glue gun

I used the laser cutter to create the rectangles for the box, the xbox logo button, and to create the controller top and bottom pieces. I used the ruler to measure

out all my pieces so that I could fit everything together precisely. The scissors were for cutting out plastic pieces or resizing them. And the hot glue gun was what

I used to keep everything together. 

<span style= "font-size:24px">**Final Product**</span>

Here's my final product: 

![IMG_9881](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/115321604-2f6d1400-a152-11eb-8522-ea430a99236d.jpg)

![IMG_9879](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70911079/115321606-2f6d1400-a152-11eb-9693-b668ebd297bc.jpg)

It turned out pretty close to how I wanted it to with a few exceptions. I think the closing mechanism is a little different than what I wanted because

I need to make sure the joystick is allgined properly to put the lid on everytime. Also the buttons aren't pushable because they need more backing so they 

have something to rest against when pushed to actually make the clicking sound that happens when you push the button. The middle xbox button works and so does 

the movement pad buttons but the other ones do not click as of now which I wish I gotten done. Otherwise, I like the design and how it looks on the outside and am

proud of what I did get working in the end.
